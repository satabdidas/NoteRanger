#NoteRanger

A toy information retrieval system to
  - understand how an IR works
  - search the notes that I make in markdown format

The query part is taken from David Branner's [notes](https://github.com/branner-non-code/notes/tree/gh-pages) repo with some modifications.

## TODO

1. Normalize terms
   a. Equivalence classing of terms
      For instance all the following belong to the same class {windows, window, Windows, Window}
2. Deciding the stop words
3. Make AND/OR queries
